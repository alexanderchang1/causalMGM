Description: This is an R package that allow users to learn undirected and directed (causal) graphs over mixed data types (i.e., continuous and discrete variables). To learn a directed graph over mixed data, it first calculates the undirected graph (Sedgewick et al, 2016) and then it uses local search strategies to prune-and-orient this graph (Sedgewick et al, 2017).
